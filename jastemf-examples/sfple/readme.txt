This project is an internal test for JastEMF problems w.r.t. JastAdd compilers with complex rewrites.

                                             The
                            EMF INTEGRATED INTERPRETER IS ERRONEOUS
                           because of rewriting issues within the EMF.

Example error: {1,2,3,4,5} * {1,2,3,4,5} should yield {1,4,9,16,25} but yields {1,9,25}.
