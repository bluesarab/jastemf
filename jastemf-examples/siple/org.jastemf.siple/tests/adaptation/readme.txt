This folder contains all AspectJ specifications and Java source code files
required to prepare SiPLE for semantic regression tests with RTT. Two possible
adaptation scenarios exist:
 - For the basic version (generated by JastAdd)
 - For the EMF compatible version (generated by JastAdd and adapted to
   the EMF by JastEMF). Beware, the required adaptations for RTT have to be
   delayed until JastEMF has been executed.
