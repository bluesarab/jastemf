                                 NEW FEATURES
===============================================================================

Finishing the extension to a small, Turing complete, imperative programming
language:
	- Rename to SIPLE (Simple Imperative Programming Language Example).
	- Add constant folding, i.e. each expression has a new attribute
	  ConstantValue() that has a value iff the expression's value does not
	  depend on a state (Expressions depend on a state iff they depend on any
	  value computed by a procedure call or a while loop; Rationale: Procedures
	  and while loops are possibly non-terminating).

Add control-flow analysis as described in "Declarative Intraprocedural Flow
Analysis of Java Source Code".

Extend the converter to extract semantic interfaces from JastAdd ast and jrag
specifications for ECore.

Use ticket system on Google code instead of this document :-)!
