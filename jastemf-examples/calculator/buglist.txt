                                 NEW FEATURES
===============================================================================

Testing the new interpretation features and constructs (if, while, procedure
calls).

Updating the RTT integration.

Finishing the extension to a small, Turing complete, imperative programming
language:
	- Fix variable name space w.r.t. parameters, i.e. extend declared
	  parameters' scope to their procedure's body.
	- Rename to SIPLE (Simple Imperative Programming Language Example).
	- Add constant folding, i.e. each expression has a new attribute
	  ConstantValue() that has a value iff the expression's value does not
	  depend on a state (Expressions depend on a state iff they depend on any
	  value computed by a procedure call or a while loop; Rationale: Procedures
	  and while loops are possibly non-terminating).

Add control-flow analysis as described in "Declarative Intraprocedural Flow
Analysis of Java Source Code".
