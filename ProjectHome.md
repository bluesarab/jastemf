# Welcome to JastEMF #

_JastEMF_ is a tool to support the integrated use of the _[JastAdd](http://www.jastadd.org)_ system --- a rewriteable, circular, reference attribute grammar (ReCRAG) generator --- and the _[Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF)](http://www.eclipse.org/modeling/emf/)_ --- a Java based metamodeling framework built around the _Ecore_ metamodeling language. The objective of JastEMF is to permit the specification of an Ecore metamodel's semantics using a JastAdd _ReCRAG_. Given an Ecore metamodel and an appropriate JastAdd _abstract syntax tree (AST)_ the metamodel's semantics --- i.e. the value and behavior of its _derived attributes_, _non-containment references_ and _operations_ --- can be specified using JastAdd. In essence, JastAdd can be used to **define** the metamodel elements that are only **declared** in the metamodel.

## Features ##

  * Approach for metamodel semantics based on well-known compiler construction theories
    * [Mapping between attribute grammar concepts and metamodelling concepts](Approach.md)
    * Due to JastAdd, the framework is very convenient to specify semantics (A detailed list of JastAdd's features can be found [here](http://www.jastadd.org/)).
  * Transparent integration of EMF metamodeling and JastAdd attribute grammars
    * Metamodel implementation, AG evaluator and integration artifacts are transparently merged into a single class hierarchy that is an appropriate metamodel and semantic implementation
    * Support for the generation of JastAdd AST specifications for a given Ecore metamodel
  * Easy and familiar development process
    * Build process via a single [Ant task](Ant_Tasks.md) supported by JastEMF
    * EMF metamodel and JastAdd AG development can be handeled as used to. There are no special measures required for integration. Everything is handled by JastEMF.
    * Integration artefacts generated by JastEMF are well documented, so the user can easily comprehend metamodel and AG evaluator adaptations.

## When to use JastEMF? ##

JastEMF considers multiple use cases (incomplete list):
  * Development of classical AG based compiler frontends that should be embedded into a state-of-the-art MDSD (Model Driven Software Devlopment) framework
  * Development of small and medium sized text-based Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) including static semantics (e.g., resolving of cross references, type analysis etc.) and execution semantics (e.g., specifying operations code)
  * Adding further reasoning support when serialising and deserialising model instances (e.g. from XMI) in general.
  * Combine attribute grammars with other existing Model-to-Model, Text-to-Model or Model-to-Text technologies.
  * Use AGs for reasoning over XML files by combining JastAdd with XSD-to-Ecore bindings.
